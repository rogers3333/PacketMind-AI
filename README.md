# PacketMind-AI
PacketMind AI is a cutting-edge cross-platform network packet capture and analysis tool built with Rust, Tauri, and AI. It delivers real-time traffic monitoring, automatic protocol parsing (TCP/UDP/HTTP/DNS), and intelligent anomaly detectionâ€”addressing the "heavy capture, light analysis" gap of traditional tools.
